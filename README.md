# Beijing-PM2.5-Dataset-Project

This project aims to build machine learning models to predict the PM2.5 concentration in Beijing based on other features including Dew Point, Temperature, Pressure, Combined wind direction and so on.

This Beijing PM2.5 dataset consists of information of various features including weather parameters (Temperature, pressure, dew point, combined wind direction, 
cumulated wind speed, cumulated hours of snow, and cumulated hours of rain), PM2.5 concentration in Beijing of each hour in a day from 2010.01.01 to 2014.12.31. PM2.5 
pollution had been a challenging problem over that period of time in Beijing, so it could be helpful to predict the PM2.5 concentration from given information on the weather parameters in this dataset.

The Beijing PM2.5 dataset was taken from UCL Machine Learning Repository, and the link is:https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Beijing+PM2.5+Data

In this project, the dataset was first loaded, descirptive and exploratory analysis was done where a few plots was generated to explore potential relationship between different features in the data set, then the data is preprocessed and fit to different machine learning models to compare the performance.
